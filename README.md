<h1>Welcome to an attempt at a "Chat" "Generator".</h1>
<p>This project is the final statement for my AI & The Humanities class.</p>
<p>The code and the images for this project were edited by hand, but generated with ChatGPT 4o with Canvas and ChatGPT's Pixel Art+ integration.</p>
<p>The text for the Markov chains that make up the "Chat" include all my discussion posts (1) and all my discussion comments (2) from the semester.</p>
<p>Read the process note on-site for more information, or visit the links embedded at the bottom to learn more about what I was up to this semester!</p>
